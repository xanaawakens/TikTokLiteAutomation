# Fixes for Table Concatenation Errors and Stack Overflow Prevention

## Issue Overview
The codebase experienced two related issues:

1. **"attempt to concatenate a table value"** errors in various locations within the `auto_tiktok.lua` file (around lines 133, 170, 186). These errors occur when attempting to use the string concatenation operator (`..`) with a value that is not a string or number.

2. **"too many C levels (limit is 200) in function at line 454"** error in utils.lua. This error indicates a stack overflow caused by circular dependencies between modules, specifically when logger uses utils.safeToString, and utils functions use logger.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Safe String Conversion Utility to utils.lua

Originally, we added a `safeToString` function to `utils.lua` that safely converts any value type to a string:

```lua
function utils.safeToString(value)
    if value == nil then
        return "nil"
    elseif type(value) == "string" then
        return value
    elseif type(value) == "number" or type(value) == "boolean" then
        return tostring(value)
    elseif type(value) == "table" then
        -- Xử lý table để tránh lỗi concatenation
        local success, result = pcall(function()
            -- Thử chuyển bằng tostring (có thể đã được override)
            local str = tostring(value)
            -- Nếu tostring trả về đại diện mặc định, tạo mô tả chi tiết hơn
            if str:match("^table: 0x") then
                return "{table}"
            else
                return str
            end
        end)
        
        if success then
            return result
        else
            return "{table conversion error}"
        end
    elseif type(value) == "function" then
        return "{function}"
    elseif type(value) == "userdata" or type(value) == "thread" then
        return "{" .. type(value) .. "}"
    else
        return "{unknown type: " .. type(value) .. "}"
    end
end
```

Then, to fix the stack overflow issue, we simplified this function to avoid any recursive calls or complex operations:

```lua
function utils.safeToString(value)
    if value == nil then
        return "nil"
    elseif type(value) == "string" then
        return value
    elseif type(value) == "number" or type(value) == "boolean" then
        return tostring(value)
    elseif type(value) == "table" then
        -- Không dùng pcall và đệ quy phức tạp để tránh lỗi stack overflow
        -- Trả về biểu diễn đơn giản của table
        return "{table}"
    elseif type(value) == "function" then
        return "{function}"
    elseif type(value) == "userdata" or type(value) == "thread" then
        return "{" .. type(value) .. "}"
    else
        return "{unknown type: " .. type(value) .. "}"
    end
end
```

### 2. Created Local safeToString Functions in Each Module

To break the circular dependencies between modules, we added local safeToString functions in:
- logger.lua
- error_handler.lua
- rewards_live.lua
- auto_tiktok.lua

Example from logger.lua:
```lua
-- Thêm hàm safeToString đơn giản trong logger để tránh phụ thuộc vào utils
local function safeToString(value)
    if value == nil then
        return "nil"
    elseif type(value) == "string" then
        return value
    elseif type(value) == "number" or type(value) == "boolean" then
        return tostring(value)
    elseif type(value) == "table" then
        return "{table}"
    elseif type(value) == "function" then
        return "{function}"
    elseif type(value) == "userdata" or type(value) == "thread" then
        return "{" .. type(value) .. "}"
    else
        return "{unknown type: " .. type(value) .. "}"
    end
end
```

### 3. Removed Logger Calls from Utility Functions

We commented out logger calls in utility functions to prevent circular dependencies:
- utils.retryOperation()
- utils.readFileSafely()
- utils.writeFileAtomic()
- utils.isTikTokLiteInstalled()

### 4. Updated String Concatenation in auto_tiktok.lua

Modified all string concatenation operations with potentially non-string values to use the safeToString utility:

```lua
logger.warning("Không thể xác nhận live stream đã load sau khi vuốt: " .. safeToString(loadError or ""))
```

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling in rewards_live.lua 

Updated error handling in rewards_live.lua to use safeToString for error details:

```lua
local errorObj = errorHandler.createError(
    ERROR.BUTTON_NOT_FOUND,
    "Không thể tìm " .. description,
    {details = safeToString(error)}
)
```

### 6. Enhanced Logger Module

Updated logger.lua to ensure all messages are safely converted to strings before logging:

```lua
-- Đảm bảo message là chuỗi an toàn
local safeMessage = safeToString(message)
    
-- Tạo chuỗi log
local logString = string.format("[%s] [%s] %s", timestamp, levelStr, safeMessage)
```

### 7. Enhanced Error Handler Module

Updated error_handler.lua to use safeToString for error formatting and details:

```lua
-- Nếu không phải đối tượng lỗi
err = errorHandler.createError(
    errorHandler.ERROR_CODE[errorHandler.ERROR_GROUP.GENERAL].UNKNOWN,
    safeToString(err)
)
```

## Benefits

1. Prevents crashes due to type errors in string concatenation
2. Prevents stack overflow errors from circular dependencies
3. Provides more helpful debug information when tables or other complex values are logged
4. Makes the codebase more robust against unexpected data types
5. Centralizes string conversion logic for consistency
6. Improves application stability by avoiding infinite recursion

## Design Principles Applied

1. **Breaking Circular Dependencies**: 
   - Core modules should not depend on higher-level modules
   - Create local versions of common functions when needed
   - Follow a clear dependency hierarchy: utils → logger → error_handler → business modules

2. **Defensive Programming**:
   - Always check value types before operations
   - Use safe conversion functions when dealing with unknown data types
   - Return clear error messages rather than crashing

3. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Standardized error format across the application
   - Localized error handling with global coordination
   - Suppression of non-critical errors in appropriate contexts

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Table Serialization**:
   - Implement a more detailed table serialization function with:
     - Circular reference detection
     - Depth limiting
     - Output size limiting
   
2. **Asynchronous Logging**:
   - Implement non-blocking logging to prevent performance impacts
   - Consider a buffered logging system for batch writes

3. **Automated Type Checking**:
   - Add automated type checking for critical functions
   - Consider a type annotation system for important interfaces

4. **Error Recovery Framework**:
   - Develop a more comprehensive error recovery strategy
   - Implement automated retry policies for common failure modes

## Testing Strategy

To verify these fixes, create a test script (test_concatenation.lua) that:
1. Attempts to concatenate various data types including tables
2. Tests nested structures that might cause stack overflow
3. Verifies the logger can handle complex data structures
4. Confirms circular dependencies are properly handled

## Implementation Best Practices

When working with this codebase:

1. Never use direct string concatenation (`..`) with values that might be tables
2. Always use safeToString for values passed to logger functions
3. Avoid introducing new circular dependencies between modules
4. Prefer local functions over global ones for utilities
5. Include explicit type checking for function parameters

## Additional Notes

The "too many C levels" error was caused by circular dependencies between modules, specifically when logger uses utils.safeToString, and utils functions use logger. The solution was to simplify the safeToString function and create local versions in each module to break the circular dependencies.

1. Consider implementing a more detailed table serialization function that can display the contents of tables in a readable format
2. Add type checking to critical functions to catch potential issues earlier
3. Consider adding unit tests to verify error handling in edge cases
