# Project Progress

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Basic TikTok Lite app automation
- ✅ Live stream navigation and viewing
- ✅ Reward button detection
- ✅ Claim button interaction
- ✅ Multiple account support
- ✅ Basic error handling and recovery
- ✅ Detailed logging with screenshots on failure
- ✅ Reset to account 1 after processing all accounts
- ✅ Complete error suppression for expected "not found" scenarios
- ✅ Reward screen verification after tapping reward button

### Modules
- ✅ Account management (`change_account.lua`)
- ✅ Core automation logic (`auto_tiktok.lua`)
- ✅ Live stream reward processing (`rewards_live.lua`)
- ✅ Utility functions (`utils.lua`)
- ✅ Configuration system (`config.lua`)
- ✅ Error handling system with suppression support (`error_handler.lua`)
- ✅ Logging system with suppression options (`logger.lua`)

### Features
- ✅ Auto-detection of UI elements using color patterns
- ✅ Popup handling
- ✅ Stream switching when current stream ends
- ✅ Account switching when current account completes tasks
- ✅ Error logging with screenshots
- ✅ Selective error suppression for non-critical UI elements
- ✅ Code reuse through centralized utility functions
- ✅ UI state verification to ensure proper screen navigation

## In Progress

- 🔄 Documentation of the existing codebase
- 🔄 Analysis of additional reward opportunities
- 🔄 Optimization of UI element detection reliability
- 🔄 Enhancement of error recovery mechanisms (partially completed with error suppression implementation)
- 🔄 Handling of more popup types and edge cases

## Not Yet Implemented

### Additional Reward Types
- ❌ Video watching automation (seen in screenshots)
- ❌ Daily check-in automation (seen in screenshots)
- ❌ Like task automation (seen in screenshots)
- ❌ Search task automation (seen in screenshots)
- ❌ Pet selection automation (seen in screenshots)
- ❌ Ad viewing automation (seen in screenshots)

### System Enhancements
- ❌ Unified automation framework for all reward types
- ❌ Scheduling system for optimal reward timing
- ❌ Web dashboard for monitoring automation status
- ❌ Notification system for critical errors
- ❌ Auto-updating for handling TikTok Lite UI changes
- ❌ Performance analytics for optimization

### Technical Improvements
- ✅ Code refactoring to remove duplication (implemented for swipe operations)
- ❌ Improved color pattern detection with more fallbacks
- ❌ Machine learning for more reliable UI detection
- ❌ Configurable automation strategies
- ❌ Multi-device support coordination
- ❌ Database logging for better analysis

## Known Issues

1. **UI Detection Reliability**: Color pattern detection may fail if TikTok Lite updates its UI
2. **Timing Sensitivity**: Some operations depend on fixed timing, which may not work on all devices
3. **Error Recovery Limitations**: Some complex error states may not be recoverable without manual intervention
4. **Account Switching Edge Cases**: Certain account states may cause switching failures
5. **Limited Reward Types**: Currently only implements live stream reward automation
6. **Incomplete UI Verification**: (FIXED) Navigation between screens now includes proper verification with reward screen checks

## Next Milestones

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. Complete documentation of existing codebase
2. Implement improved error recovery for common failure cases
3. Enhance UI detection reliability with fallback mechanisms
4. Add video watching automation

### Medium Term (3-4 weeks)
1. Implement daily check-in automation
2. Add search task automation
3. Create unified framework for all reward types
4. Design and implement scheduling system

### Long Term (2-3 months)
1. Build analytics dashboard for monitoring
2. Implement machine learning for adaptive UI detection
3. Create auto-updating mechanisms for UI changes
4. Develop multi-device coordination system
