# Product Context

## Purpose and Problem Statement

The TikTok Lite Automation project addresses the need to automate repetitive tasks in the TikTok Lite app that can earn users reward points. TikTok Lite offers various point-earning opportunities through:

1. Watching live streams
2. Claiming daily rewards
3. Completing tasks
4. Watching videos
5. Checking in daily
6. Searching within the app
