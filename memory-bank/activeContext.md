# Active Context

## Current Focus

The project is currently in the analysis and planning phase. Based on the codebase review and screenshots analysis, we're focusing on understanding:

1. The structure and functionality of the existing TikTok Lite automation code
2. The reward mechanisms in TikTok Lite that can be automated
3. The UI elements and interaction patterns needed for automation
4. The account management system for handling multiple accounts

## Recent Discoveries

From the code analysis:

1. The project is implemented in Lua using the TouchSprite framework for iOS automation
2. The codebase is modular with clear separation between account management, automation logic, and utility functions
3. The system uses color pattern detection and image recognition to identify UI elements
4. There's a comprehensive error handling and logging mechanism in place
5. The system supports multiple account switching

From the screenshots:

1. TikTok Lite has multiple reward mechanisms including livestream viewing, video watching, and daily tasks
2. The rewards can be converted to PayPay credits
3. There's a current Golden Week carnival campaign with increased rewards
4. The UI has clear patterns for reward buttons, claim buttons, and confirmation dialogs

## Active Decisions

1. **Architecture Enhancement**: Evaluating whether the current modular architecture is sufficient or needs enhancement
2. **Error Handling**: Considering improvements to error recovery mechanisms, especially for UI detection failures
3. **Logging**: Assessing the current logging system for improvements in error diagnosis
4. **Account Management**: Exploring optimizations for account switching and management
5. **New Reward Types**: Identifying additional reward mechanisms that could be automated

## Current Challenges

1. **UI Detection Reliability**: Ensuring reliable detection of UI elements across different device sizes and app versions
2. **Error Recovery**: Improving the system's ability to recover from unexpected states
3. **TikTok Lite Updates**: Handling potential changes in TikTok Lite's UI or reward mechanisms
4. **Account Security**: Managing accounts securely without risking detection or bans
5. **Optimization**: Finding the optimal balance between aggressiveness and reliability in the automation

## Implementation Status

Currently, the codebase shows:

1. A working implementation for livestream reward automation
2. Account switching functionality
3. Basic error handling and logging
4. Configuration management

The next focus areas appear to be:

1. Enhancing the reliability of UI element detection
2. Adding automation for additional reward types (video watching, daily check-ins)
3. Improving error recovery mechanisms
4. Optimizing the workflow for maximum point efficiency

## Next Steps

1. Create a comprehensive project structure for ongoing development
2. Document the existing codebase thoroughly
3. Identify areas for improvement or extension
4. Design enhancements for error recovery and logging
5. Plan for additional reward automation implementations
